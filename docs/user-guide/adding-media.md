# Adding Media

Mydia provides multiple ways to add media to your libraries.

The primary way to add media is through the search interface:

If you have existing media files, Mydia can import them during library scanning:

3. Mydia will match files to metadata and import them

### File Naming

For best results, use standard naming conventions:

**Movies:**

Movie Title (Year)/Movie Title (Year).mkv
```

**TV Shows:**
```
Show Title (Year)/Season 01/Show Title - S01E01 - Episode Title.mkv
```
