  @moduledoc """
  Shared module for syncing library paths and populating relative paths in media files.

  Used by both:
  - One-time migration (populate_media_file_relative_paths.exs)
  - Startup task (StartupSync)

  ## Key Responsibilities

  1. **Sync Runtime Library Paths to Database**
     - Reads library paths from runtime config (env vars, YAML)
     - Upserts them to database using path as unique key
     - Ensures database is consistent with current configuration

  2. **Match Files to Library Paths**
     - Uses longest prefix matching to find correct library path for each file
     - Handles edge cases (orphaned files, files outside library paths)

  3. **Calculate Relative Paths**
     - Converts absolute paths to relative paths
     - Stores library_path_id foreign key reference

  Syncs runtime library paths to the database.

  Reads library paths from `Settings.get_runtime_library_paths/0` and ensures
  they exist in the database. Runtime paths are upserted using the path field
  as the unique key.

  Also disables library paths that were previously created from environment
  variables but are no longer present in the config (sets monitored: false).

  This function is idempotent and safe to call multiple times.

  Returns {:ok, stats} where stats contains:
  - synced: Number of paths synced from env
  - disabled: Number of paths disabled (removed from env)
