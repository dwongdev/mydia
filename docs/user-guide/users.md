# User Management

Mydia includes a built-in multi-user system with role-based access control.

## User Roles

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Admin** | Full access: media management, downloads, configuration, request approval |
| **Guest** | Browse library, submit requests for admin approval |

## First User Setup

When you first access Mydia:

1. You're guided through creating the initial admin user
2. Choose to set a custom password or generate a secure random one
3. After creation, you're automatically logged in

## Local Authentication

By default, Mydia uses local username/password authentication.

### Configuration

```bash
LOCAL_AUTH_ENABLED=true
```

### Creating Users

Admins can create users through the Admin UI:

1. Navigate to **Admin > Users**
2. Click **Add User**
3. Enter username, email, and password
4. Select role (admin or guest)
5. Save

## OIDC/SSO Authentication

Mydia supports OpenID Connect (OIDC) for single sign-on integration.

### Supported Providers

- Keycloak
- Authelia
- Auth0
- Okta
- Azure AD
- Google
- Any OIDC-compliant provider

### Configuration

```bash
OIDC_ENABLED=true
OIDC_DISCOVERY_DOCUMENT_URI=https://your-provider/.well-known/openid-configuration
OIDC_CLIENT_ID=mydia
OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
OIDC_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:4000/auth/oidc/callback
OIDC_SCOPES=openid profile email
```

### Auto-Promotion

The first user to log in via OIDC is automatically promoted to admin role. Subsequent OIDC users are assigned guest role by default.

### Provider Configuration

Mydia uses standard OAuth2 authentication with minimal provider configuration:

- Set `client_id`, `client_secret`, and `redirect_uris` in your provider
- No need to configure token endpoint auth methods or response modes

## Request System

Guest users can request media:

1. **Guest searches** for a movie or TV show
2. **Guest clicks Request** on the search result
3. **Admin receives notification** of the request
4. **Admin reviews** and approves or denies
5. **If approved**, media is added to library and download begins
6. **Guest is notified** of the decision

### Managing Requests

Admins can view and manage requests:

1. Navigate to **Admin > Requests**
2. View pending requests
3. Approve or deny each request
4. Optionally add a message

## Disabling Authentication

!!! danger "Security Warning"
    Disabling authentication is not recommended for production deployments.

For local/testing environments, you can disable local auth when using OIDC:

```bash
LOCAL_AUTH_ENABLED=false
OIDC_ENABLED=true
```
