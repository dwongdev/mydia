defmodule Mydia.Repo.Migrations.PopulateMediaFileRelativePaths do
  @moduledoc """
  One-time migration to populate library_path_id and relative_path for existing media files.

  This migration:
  1. Syncs runtime library paths to database
  2. Populates relative_path and library_path_id for all existing media files
  3. Logs orphaned files (files outside configured library paths)

  Note: A startup task (Mydia.Library.StartupSync) will handle ongoing synchronization
  and act as a safety net for edge cases.
