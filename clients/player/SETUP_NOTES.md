# Flutter Project Setup Notes

## Status

The Flutter project structure has been created manually at `/home/arosenfeld/Projects/mydia/clients/player/`.

**IMPORTANT**: Flutter SDK is not currently installed on this system, so the following steps could not be completed:
- Running `flutter pub get` to resolve dependencies
- Running `flutter pub run build_runner build` to generate code
- Building and running the application on any platform
- Verifying that all dependencies resolve correctly

## What Was Created

### Dependencies Configured ✓
- flutter_riverpod: ^2.4.0
- riverpod_annotation: ^2.3.0
- go_router: ^12.0.0
- graphql_flutter: ^5.1.0
- flutter_secure_storage: ^9.0.0
- hive_flutter: ^1.1.0
- cached_network_image: ^3.3.0
- build_runner: ^2.4.0
- riverpod_generator: ^2.3.0
- flutter_lints: ^3.0.0

### Features Implemented ✓
- **Dark Theme**: Complete dark mode theme with Material 3
- **Navigation**: go_router with two routes (/, /login)
- **State Management**: Riverpod 2.x with code generation setup
- **Screens**: Home screen and Login screen with basic UI
- **Clean Architecture**: Folder structure ready for domain/data layers

## Next Steps (Requires Flutter SDK)

Once Flutter is installed, run these commands in order:

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd clients/player
flutter pub get
```

### 2. Generate Code
```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

This will generate:
- `lib/core/router/app_router.g.dart` - Router provider code

### 3. Verify Build
```bash
# Web (fastest)
flutter build web

# Or run in development
flutter run -d chrome
```

### 4. Test on Other Platforms
```bash
flutter run -d macos
flutter run -d android
flutter run -d ios
```

## Known Issues

1. **Generated Files Missing**: `app_router.g.dart` needs to be generated by build_runner
2. **Cannot Verify Dependencies**: Need Flutter SDK to run `flutter pub get`
3. **Cannot Test Build**: Need Flutter SDK to verify compilation

## Installation Instructions

To install Flutter SDK:

### Option 1: Using a version manager (recommended)
```bash
# FVM (Flutter Version Manager)
dart pub global activate fvm
fvm install stable
fvm use stable

# Or using asdf
asdf plugin add flutter
asdf install flutter latest
asdf global flutter latest
```

### Option 2: Direct installation
Visit: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install

### Option 3: Docker
A Flutter Docker container could be added to docker-compose.yml for development.

## Verification Checklist

Once Flutter is available, verify:

- [ ] `flutter pub get` completes without errors
- [ ] `flutter pub run build_runner build` generates `app_router.g.dart`
- [ ] `flutter analyze` shows no errors
- [ ] `flutter build web` completes successfully
- [ ] App runs and displays home screen
- [ ] Navigation to /login works
- [ ] Theme is properly applied (dark mode)
- [ ] No runtime errors in console

## Architecture Notes

The project follows Clean Architecture:
- **Presentation**: Screens and widgets (UI layer)
- **Domain**: Business logic and entities (to be implemented)
- **Data**: Repositories and data sources (to be implemented)

Riverpod is used for dependency injection and state management throughout all layers.
